- TypeScript for JS Programmers
### Types by Inference
Typescript knows the JavaScript language and will generate types for you in many cases. --
-- For example in creating a variable and assigning it to a particular value, 
```javascript
TypeScript will use the value as its type

```
By understanding how JavaScript works, TypeScript can build a type-system that accepts JavaScript code but has types.
```javascript
let helloWorld = "Hello World";
```
```javascript
This offers a type-system without needing to add extra characters to make types explicit in your code. 
Thatâ€™s how TypeScript knows that helloWorld is a string in the above example.
```
